        <p class="mt-3">Aprilia India recently launched the RS457 as its latest two-wheeler offering for the Indian market. The Italian supersport seems to have created quite a buzz and if you are planning to purchase one, here are a few things you must know about it.</p>
        <p>Triumph, which launched the Speed 400 in July 2023 at an introductory price of Rs 2.23 lakh (ex-showroom), has now announced that the inaugural offer has been extended up to December 31, 2023. The ex-showroom price is set to increase to Rs 2.33 lakh from January 1, 2024.

Since its global debut, the Speed 400 has joined Triumph's successful modern classic line-up, which includes models like the Speed Twin 900 and 1200. Additionally, the Scrambler 400 X, inspired by the Scrambler 900 and 1200, offers a rugged design with off-road capabilities reminiscent of the first factory Scramblers of the 1950s.

Triumph, in collaboration with Bajaj, has witnessed remarkable growth in its Indian market presence. The Speed 400 marked a significant milestone for it, with the company expanding to over 50 showrooms across over 40 cities. With plans for dealership expansion, Triumph aims to reach 80 cities by April 2024, catering to a vibrant community of over 20,000 satisfied customers, the company shared.</p>
